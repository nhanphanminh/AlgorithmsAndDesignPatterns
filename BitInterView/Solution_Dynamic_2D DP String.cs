        //        This looks just like a straight forward string matching, isn’t it? Couldn’t we just match the pattern and the input string character by character? The question is, how to match a '*' ?

        //A natural way is to use a greedy approach; that is, we attempt to match the previous character as many as we can.Does this work? Let us look at some examples.

        //s = “abbbc”
        //p = “ab* c”
        //Assume we have matched the first ‘a’ on both s and p.When we see "b*" in p, we skip all b’s in s.Since the last ‘c’ matches on both side, they both match.

        //s = “ac”
        //p = “ab* c”
        //After the first ‘a’, we see that there is no b’s to skip for “b*”. We match the last ‘c’ on both side and conclude that they both match.

        //It seems that being greedy is good.But how about this case?

        //s = “abbc”
        //p = “ab* bbc”
        //When we see “b*” in p, we would have skip all b’s in s.They both should match, but we have no more b’s to match.Therefore, the greedy approach fails in the above case.

        //One might be tempted to think of a quick workaround. How about counting the number of consecutive b’s in s? If it is smaller or equal to the number of consecutive b’s after “b*” in p, we conclude they both match and continue from there. For the opposite, we conclude there is not a match.

        //This seem to solve the above problem, but how about this case:

        //s = “abcbcd” 
        //p = “a.* c.*d”
        //Here, “.*” in p means repeat ‘.’ 0 or more times.Since ‘.’ can match any character, it is not clear how many times ‘.’ should be repeated.Should the ‘c’ in p matches the first or second ‘c’ in s? Unfortunately, there is no way to tell without using some kind of exhaustive search.

        //We need some kind of backtracking mechanism such that when a matching fails, we return to the last successful matching state and attempt to match more characters in s with ‘*’. This approach leads naturally to recursion.


        //The recursion mainly breaks down elegantly to the following two cases:


        //If the next character of p is NOT ‘*’, then it must match the current character of s.Continue pattern matching with the next character of both s and p.
        //If the next character of p is ‘*’, then we do a brute force exhaustive matching of 0, 1, or more repeats of current character of p… Until we could not match any more characters.
        //You would need to consider the base case carefully too. That would be left as an exercise to the reader. :)
